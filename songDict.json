Which song would you suggest?\" I said, \"NO DANCING QUEEN!\" (because that is always the obvious choice).  I wanted a song that the average casual ABBA listener most likely had never heard of, and one I loved. 'As Good As new' was it!  Also, my niece and her boyfriend had been together for 10 years, so this wedding was to make their relationship 'as good as new.'  During the reception, the music was pretty lame. An hour later, my niece approached us and said, \"He has not played your song yet?\" I said no. She marched over to the DJ.....and within 5 minutes, the strings we know and love came on.  Everyone stopped. What was this???  Then the strings stopped and the song hit!  I knew people would jump. I dragged my niece (still in her wedding gown!) and my partner to the dance floor and we let it loose.  And the dance floor, which was almost empty until now, was suddenly full.  People loved this!  And it forced the DJ to finally start playing great music to follow.  I have known and loved this song since 1979 and now, every time I hear it, I think of Gabrielle's wedding.",

        "Una de las m√°s grandes composiciones de ABBA. ABBA pone la innovaci√≥n y el arte por encima de lo f√°cil, mon√≥tono y comercial. \"Hole In Your Soul\" es de esas canciones explosivas y avasalladoras que te sacuden el alma. Est√° muy bien construida con quiebres de ritmos, contrapuntos musicales y vocales. Tiene una atm√≥sfera progresiva, vanguard√≠sta, algo que no caracteriz√≥ a ABBA  y que solamente lo logr√≥ con esta y algunas otras canciones de su √°lbum m√°s serio \"The Album\"  y con el √∫ltimo track del √°lbum The Visitors ‚ÄúLike An Angel Passing Through My Room‚Äù",

Finally, the way the two women walk into the sunset. They lost  the loves of their lives, but they gained the deepest friendship of their lives.",

The name reflects the emotional and introspective nature of Adele's songs, which often evoke deep feelings and reflections, akin to the act of daydreaming.\n\nIn her song \"Daydreamer\" she described her first crush on this perfect boy from her childhood. In an open interview she once said that \"Daydreamer\" is basically her dream man, her ideal perfect man. Although she can never have such a person in her life (as claimed by her), her fans adopted the name \"Daydreamers\" to commemorate that even though she may not have that perfect man, she will always have us.

I still can't listen to it all the way through.",
        "I have listened to many wonderful pieces of music in my 74 years. This particular piece goes beyond a treat for the ears, this piece goes straight to the soul of the listener. It can only be described as musical perfection. The clock becomes a percussion instrument, each beat is one step closer to the fate that awaits us all, it has no regard about life, it will keep ticking weather we are here or not, the fact that the clock stops at the end of the song tells us the fate of the person in the song. The orchestral accompanyment is partially muted, as an older person might hear it. Even the room acoustics are right, very little reverb as one would expect in a small room with soft furnishings.

        "Why is this never played on the radio, missed it all these years and it's wonderful!",
        "This track is from the Abba Waterloo album, one of the most crimminally underestimated albums of all time.  Three other very great albums, obviously by the Beatles, are Sgy Pepper, Rubber soul, and Revolver, and the Waterloo album can live in this kind of company.  \nThe two blistering tracks, are Suzy hang around, a worthy number one, and the one that did get the attention it deserved, Waterloo.  \n\nWhat about Livingstone is worth a top three hit, and Hasta Mannan and  Dance while th emusic still goes on are top five worthy hits.  Honey honey is also worth a top five.  And yet nother worthy of a top three hit is the huantingly Gonna sing you my love song.  It is amazing that My Mamma said appears to be one of the more medium strength tracks.  But waht is medium for Abba, or the 1970s, makes a mockery of what passes for so called music in current times.  Many of the B-sides of the 1970s simply blast out of the water most modern music, so called.  \n\nIt's when you listen to My Mamma through headphones on a good sound system, that you notice Abba packed a llot more than first appears, into into an upper medium song.  Does it have a slightly tropical feel to it, with some of the instruments used?  A lot of commentators on this Youtube clip clearly know their music, and picked up on the funk aspects of this song.  \n\nBack in the 60s and 70s the Eurovision song contest did used to be reasonably good.  Many teenagers would watch, but then so would would families and even grannies.  Very pop based Puppett on as tring was the usual fair.  Abba were quite daring using the very Rock based Waterloo.  Some middle aged people of the time possibly never got over the shock.  A Eurovison band could be a bit gimmicky, and on an album you find the Eurovision winner and at best two medium tracks and a lot of fillers, two of which sounded like rewrokings of the big hit.  But with Abba Waterloo you get an astonishingly good album, almsot full of top five hits.  The weakest tracks, well weak for Abba smashes the output of other bands to pieces, are Watch out, Sitting in the palm tree, and King Kong Song.  But King kong is still good value, it's a bit wild, and lots of fun.",

Al√©m disso, a partir dela foi que percebi as m√∫sicas ultramegachad, aquelas que n√£o se ouve o tempo todo, mas sim que merecem um tempo s√≥ para elas. √â o tipo de m√∫sica √† qual a gente muito se apega, por tanto representar nosso inconsciente. √â esse tipo de m√∫sica que ultrapassa qualquer fraca expectativa de lembran√ßa, uma vez que nos acompanha durante toda a vida, como um anjo da guarda que n√≥s sabemos que sempre estar√° l√°. Obviamente a sensa√ß√£o com certeza n√£o vai ser a mesma para cada pessoa. Cada um tem sua m√∫sica ultramegachad, uma vez que essas denominam as pessoas, as quais tem diferentes essencias.

It came on the mix at a restaurant and I had the strangest feeling come over me as I began to recognize it.\nShazam this! I yelled at my friends. They all knew it of course.\nI came home and sat here listening to the song, feeling myself looking back in time at my child self, both of us transfixed. It felt mystical. Like some kind of miracle to hear it again. And so strange that the lyrics were about time, and I felt myself a part of that river of self and time, grown now but still standing, as if in both places.\nI'm only sharing this  because I started to read all the other comments and saw how so many people connect deeply with this song, and I want my tears to join in with theirs...",

I would see her and always wanted to tell her but never did. Finally, in my junior year in high school (her senior year) at a school dance, the last one of the year, one of the last few songs of the night, this song came on. I spotted her across the room and said to myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now or never.‚Äù I summoned up all the courage I had and went over to her and asked her to dance. She said, ‚ÄúAbsolutely!‚Äù We strode over to the dance floor and started slow dancing. I couldn‚Äôt believe it was actually happening. She was tired from dancing all night and just laid her head on my shoulder as we danced. Time seemed to stand still as I couldn‚Äôt believe the girl of my dreams was here and dancing with me so close. Then before I knew it, the song ended. She hugged me and went back to her friends and I went back to mine and sat back and soaked it all in. She graduated and I never got to tell her how I felt and never saw her again. But for one moment in time, I had the girls of my dreams in my arms for five minutes and eleven seconds. I often think about her. A few years ago, I sent her a friend request on FB and she accepted. I check in on her FB every now and then. I wonder if she even remembers the dance, probably not, but I will remember it for a lifetime and that‚Äôs okay.",

In memory of Elizabeth Reed, Whipping Post, One way out, Not my cross to bear and so many others are incredible (particularly on this album) none is quite as majestic as this.

And to think he played this brilliantly and magically on this live record, and on Derek and The Dominos, between the ages of 21-23 years old, is nothing shy of mind-blowing! I've heard some amazing guitarists in my time, such as Terry Kath, Steve Howe, Alex Lifeson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Pete Townsend, Eric Clapton, Frank Zappa, etc. etc. etc., but Duane was absolutely up there, at the very top of the list, with the best of them!

        "There has never been a band like this ever nor will it appear again. Everything lined up perfectly for this band to give us the most amazing music ever laid down. Classical aside no rock band from rock to country had the \"gift\" this band had. Duane was the most amazing guitar player, Dickey was no slouch either. Duane had the fire, the inner flame while Dickey had the control and the musical knowledge. No duo ever will reach the level of interplay they had. Berry, the best. He had a solid approach that pushed this band to the highs it acheived in any given jam. Gregg Butch Jaimoe, amazing rhythm section.\nThis is only band that after 30 years of listening can produce the emotions I felt when I first heard them. Jaw dropping goosebumps. Blast it as loud as your speakers can and soak up that sweet, sweet Gibson sound..",

Based on the old question \"If you were stranded on an island and only had one album to choose to listen to, which would it be?\" I've always told people I would choose live at the Fillmore East. Never, ever get tired of listening to it. Just love it!",
        "I think one of the main things that set Duane apart from all other guitar players, and this applies to slide guitar and regular guitar, was his crystal clear and perfect intonation. Not to mention his fabulous tone, with out the gimmicks, pedals, etc. that other players used.\nThen there is his dynamics, and touch.... unparalleled in my opinion. I play a little, and every time I listen to this, since it came out eons ago, I am blown away. Truly, a once in a lifetime genius!",

The sad ending showed someone that really really wanted to get rid of billitate it and change yet still love someone that was enslaved by that demon of alcohol and didn't want to change. Unfortunately that happened sometimes. The Bible warns us that bad company corrupts. So sometimes we have to leave those entrapments to have a healthy life. Anyone who loves their addiction more than a person is not worthy of their love. And if they cannot love a person they're they can't see there's no way that they would love God who they cannot see.

It took me at least 40 years to find out the title and who had the hit with it, 3 years earlier. I thought maybe someone had a remake release of this 1961 hit in fall 1964, but I haven't been able to find one. Probably the disk jockey especially liked this song and played it a lot that year.\n\nMisheard lyrics - I thought the singer was saying, \"That old Bill Bowers moon,\" and I found the real title by Googling these lyrics. I guess I wasn't the only one who heard them that way!\n\nI first learned the phrase \"chug-a-lug\" in both this song and \"Chug-A-Lug\" by Roger Miller, which really was a fall 1964 hit, but I didn't know what it meant until several years later. (I was 12 in fall 1964.)\n\nFinally, I thought I remembered Ray Charles being part of the artist name for \"That Old Bill Bowers Moon\", but neither Ray Charles nor the Ray Charles Singers appears to have recorded \"The Bilbao Song\" in 1964 or any other year.",

        "Arlo has an awesome voice...theres no one like him",
        "In this, it's earliest recorded form, dating from the 1840s, Shennandoah or Shanadore most likely originated with the fur trappers or flatboatmen who traveled the Missouri River in their canoes in this period. The song traveled down the Mississippi to to New Orleans to the coast, where it was picked up by sailors as a Sea Shanty, and was saved from oblivion in an article in 1876 written around sailor's songs. \n\nI think it one of America's most beautiful and poignant songs in it's original form. It foreshadows what shortly befall Native Americans from the perspective of the white beaver trappers who saw what was coming. \n\nShennandoah is an Indian chief of the Oneida Iroquois tribe, and he has a lovely daughter. A white trader and she fall in love, and the trader wants to take her away, offering money, which the chief disdains. Afterwards, a Yankee skipper comes along and steals her away anyways. At the end of the song, she sings from afar of missing hearing her father's voice.\n\nShennandoah is wonderful in the way it portrays America's western advancing inevitability, and it's repercussions forever for those in our ancestor's path. It is interesting in the way it describes the events in a neutral way, not claiming the whites as superior nor the indians as inferior. The love affair levels the field, depicting all as people, and the love as doomed as the cutlure being run down by the advancement of the encroaching newcomers from the east. \n\nWith it's touching lyrics and soaring, rolling tune, it deserves to be remembered in it's original state. Through much of the 20th century, it has suffered from a lack of honesty- being dumbed down and whitewashed into a meaningless jumble of words which remove it's powerful message of humanity and suffering. America, and especially native Americans deserve better. This is a gem, one of our National Treasures that needs remembered for as long as our country stands.",
        "Arlo has a gift between emotions and words; like his father and re-new and for a renewed hope for Justice.",

        "Interesting tidbits from Wikipedia: \n\n=====================\n\nThe Oneida oral tradition tells that Chief Skenandoa provided critical food, sending corn to General George Washington and his men during their harsh winter at Valley Forge in 1777-1778. Washington is said to have named the Shenandoah River and valley in his honor, and subsequently numerous other places in the United States were named Shenandoah. He is also referred to in the title and lyrics of the folk song \"Oh Shenandoah\".\n\n=====================\nSkenandoa lived into great old age. Nearing the end of his life and having gone blind, the chief is recorded as having said:\n\n\"I am an aged hemlock*. I am dead at the top. The winds of an hundred winters have whistled through my branches. Why my Jesus keeps me here so long, I cannot conceive. Pray ye to him, that I may have patience to endure till my time may come.\"\n\nAfter Skenandoah died in 1816 at well over a hundred years old, he was buried upon his request (and with the Kirkland family's approval) next to his friend Kirkland, who had died in 1808, on the grounds of Kirkland's home in Clinton, New York. Today the property is known as Harding Farm. As a measure of the respect for the chief, the procession at his funeral in 1816 included students and officers from Hamilton College, the widow Mrs. Kirkland and other members of her family, and numerous town residents, in addition to his son and members of his family and nation. In 1851, both bodies were reinterred in the cemetery of Hamilton College, of which Kirkland was a co-founder.\n\n* Skenandoa is Oneida for \"hemlock\".",

HOWEVER, the other day while driving my wife was listening to her late 90s/early 2000s pop mix on Spotify and this song came up. It instantly transported me back to my life during the early 2000s which by no means was a fairy tale, but it might as well be given the hell hole our society has become over the last several years. Those were much brighter, optimistic, and fun times without question. Hearing this song made me miss people, places, and things I haven't seen in nearly 20 years.

Then, school year ended so fast because of the pandemic, and we didn't get to say goodbye. A few days ago, he told me he will go in another high school next year, so we won't see each other again. So I'm here, listening to this song that used to make me feel so happy and more in love that I was, and now hurt me so bad. I know I will miss him, and that school will never be the same without him, and our loud laughs, cause he knew so well how to make me laugh, and God knows it's a hard task. Maybe someday I will get over it, but at the moment it's really complicated. Our songs will always be OUR songs, I promise you, I will not forget you.

        "No matter what anyone thinks of Avril for me, as a guitar teacher, Avril was great in the 2000's. So many young students came to me wanting to learn her tunes. For a lot of my students Avril was the first music they ever played on guitar. To see a young kid walking out of the studio I teach out of feeling empowered because they can play the music they love, well... Nothing will ever beat that feeling, so it doesn't matter what I or anyone else thinks of her music. She inspired an entire generation. That's important, and I got to watch that happen in real time.",
        "I stagehanded a small festival that Avril headlined in the early aughts. There were rumblings all day that she was super sick and going to cancel. When it was time for her set to start, she had to be carried to the side of the stage, puked in the trash can next to the stairs. Then she hauled herself up onto the stage and performed her guts out for an hour before saying goodnight, walking off stage, and basically collapsing. None of the middle schoolers that looked up to her and came out to see her would have had any idea.\nHer music's still not my thing, but that's seriously bad ass and I've had total respect for her since then.",

        "The fact that she made Hello Kitty as obnoxious as it is and still be a banger is mind blowing to me.\nThere aren't many people who can pull it off",
        "As a woman that grew up in a very sexist religious atmosphere as a child, my dad allowing me to listen to Avril Lavigne when I was ten or eleven changed my entire world, and I felt comfortable being assertive because she was assertive and her music was assertive. Otherwise, and I honestly mean this, I may have turned out just like the rest of the environment I grew up in. She was the first ‚Äúsecular‚Äù artist I was given permission to listen to. And I am still one of her biggest fans today.",

Just wanna validate your approach (and fancy looking new camera set up) and say it's noticeable and cool. I have had the same experience in the country music world, watching artists that seemed like such gimmicks eventually gain the respect of the whole intelligentsia, self included, and prove that they did have a vision for their careers. That has definitely has gotten me to approach new acts with a more curious mind than I used to.",
        "During my battle jacket punk teen years I used to stand up for Avril Lavigne if anyone talked shit. Her songs are so fun and catchy. People always thought I was bullshitting them and were perplexed that, nah, you can be a crusty, grindy punk and still have hella fun listening to a banger Avril song. Great video dude.",

Was it ALL her? No. However, she made it big with Sk8er Boi when I was in the 8th grade and from that point on, watching her (even if she was just a few years older than I was at the time - it felt like a much bigger gap, then) helped me make my choices that went against the grain. Choices I'd been conditioned to make since birth. I'll always be grateful to her for that.",

She puts a lot of work into everything that she creates and everything she makes really is hers.",

When I was a kid I was the only girl in my class who hated wearing typically feminine clothes and loved rock music, and Avril was the first person that made me think that being a girl was pretty cool, and that I was doing right by being myself. Because of her I got into blink, the distillers, rancid, fugazi, and a ton more artists. One thing that always felt special about her to me is that she always felt like a friend as well as an artist. Forever stanning this woman.",

        "To her absolute credit, Avril was for 2000s teens, what Gwen Stefani was for 90s teens. She really straddled the line between pop punk, and the late 90s alt rock/pop grunge sound of Lifehouse,  Switchfoot, and Goo Goo Dolls, so well that it seemed effortless. \n\nI'm With You is a top tier song, and I still listen to it regularly.",
        "Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte are guilty pleasures of mine. They did a lot to introduce preteens into alternative and punk. Also she‚Äôs still a total stunner.",
        "\"I'm with you\" has always been a personal favorite of mine.",
        "You totally forgot to mention \"I'm with you\" and \"losing grip\". Those are the best from her imo",
        "I really love this video! It strikes a chord with me because I feel defensive toward young folks with talent who get dissed and women with talent who get dissed, and I also love cheering for people who share my nationality who find success outside of Canada.\n\nI‚Äôm sharing this with a friend who was a big Avril fan about 14 years ago.",
        "Well put. Her track with Mod Sun has had me delving a bit deeper into her work lately. I remember when Skater Boi was all over mtv2 and genuinely liking the track. Even though she was obviously more a pop artist than part of the rock world back then i think over time she has come to be regarded as a credible artist and one of the more significant ones to bridge that gap.",
        "Another good video my man. ‚Äúlosing grip‚Äù is a personal favourite of mine \n\nIt was probably intentional, but I‚Äôm surprised you didnt touch on the ‚Äúshe‚Äôs dead but she has been cloned‚Äù story! lol",
        "I actually started tearing up at the end of this. Thank you so much. You made just about every point that I always try to make whenever people rip on Avril Lavigne in my presence.\n\nI have been absolutely ridiculed over the years for looking up to her and tbh kinda shaping my entire personality around hers. But whenever people drag her in front of me, I tell them to listen to her ALBUMS, not the singles. A lot of my favourite songs never saw the light of mainstream media. So many incredible tunes that usually, 9 times out of 10, surprise the fuck out of people when I show them. I even made my damn Ex come to respect her after listening to her full discography.\n\nI have Avril to owe for everything I grew up to be. She taught me so much. Not to take any shit, hold tight to who I am and what I want and never settle for less, and love with my heart on my sleeve.\n\nSo yeah, I might be a little Avril wannabe, still, at 28, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Little Black Star (that's her fandoms name haha) for Life, man! ",
        "I LIVED Avril Lavigne in my teens. Her music was like the girl you brought home to meet mom. Avril's music is poppy enough that your parents wouldn't mind you listening to her while you also listened to heavier quote end quote \"true\" punk music behind their back. I still openly jam her music from time to time. Avril is the shit. 'Nuff said.",
        "I just like that she wasn‚Äôt preachy or got into politics. She just let her music speak for itself!",
        "This is a great deep dive into something that has such widespread opinions. Great video Finn! \n\nI wish more labels listened to the artists themselves.",
        "I finally started digging into her music last year and now she's one of my fav artists.",
        "She is and always will be a very talented singer. Her voice is incredible.",
        "honestly Avril was carrying y2k fashion",
        "Idk what anyone‚Äôs problem with Avril is...I‚Äôve loved that girl since I was out causing trouble, skateboarding and jamming to Motley Crue lol I‚Äôve never been ashamed to sing along with some Avril songs hahaha",
        "It's interesting to compare Avril's career to that of Alanis Morissette. Alanis actually did comply with the system and record two pop albums before making Jagged little pill and transitioning to rock. And yet, her rock debut was considered \"legit\". The only difference I can come up with was the perceived maturity. Morissette started with You Oughta Know, an angry anthem of a woman scorned. Lavigne debuted with a song about a boy, while showing an edgy teenage girl aesthetics. And I believe one thing rockers disregard more than women in rock is girls in rock. We as a society really hate what teenage girls like. And the rock scene is even worse than the rest of the society.",
        "I think I had a similar experience to a lot of people here. In the 2000's when I was in middle school I didn't really consider it an option to like Avril. I dismissed her as girly/poppy/uncool. Now as an adult I have gone back and am not ashamed to say I love a lot of her songs. I wish I had had more confidence as a kid to just listen to whatever sounded good.",
        "I never thought of her being a pop punk artist i always viewed her as a pop artist with punk aesthetic like Pink",
        "I grew up down the road from where Avril did. I was a few years older, but her style of dress was very much what we wore in that region a few years earlier (pre,during, and post Grunge era). When I first saw her on Muchmusic, I was blown away by how local she appeared.",
        "She only has six albums but she was fighting lyme disease for a long time starting in 2015, which kept her from writing.",
        "I'm so glad Mod Sun is a huge fan of this channel, so I know Avril will more than likely see this amazing video about her",
        "I never grew up with Avril Lavigne, but she‚Äôs freaking awesome and talented.",
        "The same hate avril gets is the same hate Billie is getting. I hate it, Avril was my idol growing up, and I respect and enjoy Billie's music. They both broke boundaries and paved ways for new music/artist. They are probably some of the most humble authentic artist around today.",
        "thank you very much for the video\nHere in Brazil we love her a lot\nI follow her since 2002\nI love this woman",
        "Her 2nd Album was terrific, IMO.  TOGETHER, TAKE ME AWAY, DON'T TELL ME, and HOW DOES IT FEEL are all great.",
        "Screw the elitists. I effing LOVE Avril Lavigne.",
        "I was 19 when Avril Lavigne broke big and was knee deep in hardcore (especially ebullition, level-plane, robotic empire, gravity, gold standard labs, etc underground \"screamo\" type stuff). Being that into DIY hardcore, I wasn't watching MTV and hardly ever listened to the radio. I think I heard the first three Avril Lavigne singles (how could you avoid them?) and couldn't have given a damn about the punk influence. I knew it wasn't \"real\" punk, whatever that is, but was past the point in my life where I was insecure enough to care. I feel like every fan of a genre which is very tribal/\"underground\"/community based eventually reached a turning point they realize that \"fake\" versions of what they are into, or younger people who are \"posers\" are some of the least important things in the entire world.",
        "All these years later, my daughter is hooked on her back catalogue as if it came out yesterday. She was 9 when she discovered her, changed her look overnight and now, at 12, still sings her songs with a belting passion and is introducing me to cool new music that would have completely passed me by. That is legacy.",
        "Avril is underrated and deserves so much more credit for the way she paved for so many bands and artists out today",
        "I'm so happy to see this video. I'm oldschool punk. Started going to shows in Seattle in 1979. Saw D.O.A., The Refuzors, The Subhumans (Canada), Black Flag, Bad Brains, The Accused with their original singer John before Blaine from The Fartz joined and they went crossover thrash, and many, many more, and the first time I heard \"Ska8r Boi\" I said, \"This is fuckin' great!\" My punk friends, to put it mildly, disagreed. As for me, I developed even more respect for Avril when I saw her live shows on YouTube and felt the passion in her performance, not to mention her great singing. I had no idea what a badass she was at 16 when she told L. A. Reid they had to change the direction and sound of her first album. Amazing. And what about her live cover of Metallica's \"Fuel\" for MTV icon? It was fantastic! So yes, praise Avril. She's a really cool person and one helluva performer.",
        "Thanks sooo much for this video! I was probably  \"too goth\" and \"too old\" to be as obsessed with Avril as I was in the early 2000's (I was in my early 20's), but I absolutely loved her first two albums. The albums following \"Under My Skin\"  weren't completely to my taste, but you were totally right about there being a few absolute bangers on all of them. I love her songs with Mod Sun and Willow Smith, and am super excited for her new pop-punk album!",
        "Besides her music, I remember being a huge fan in 2010-11-ish (I was born in '99) and absolutely loving her Bast Damn Thing era. In contrary to her iconic tomboy style, this one was very girly and focused in being cute and edgy, for example the pink-black combo with hearts and skulls. That was probably my transition from childish clothing to teenage fashion. I wanted to own those clothes so bad but that clothing was never available in my country because emo/scene never arrived here. To add, I was embarrassed to ask my mom for edgier clothes.",
        "My brother plays in Oi! And hardcore Bands, skated in the 80s and 90s, etc. and he listens to Avril. Like what u like. Fuck what other people think.",
        "She's really talented and hardworking girl with a sense of humour. Always sings live and sings PERFECT. I used to be a big fan. Nowadays I'm not into being a fan of any musician but Avril still got a a huge place in my heart. And she really has that pop-punk and pop-rock vibes and she's a multiinstrumentalist.",
        "I was surprised by how much I liked hearing about her history. I've never been a fan of Avril, but my sister definitely was when we were kids. I remember hearing Avril's voice come through the walls between our rooms constantly during our summer vacations. Sometimes it drove me crazy, but even I thought she had a couple decent songs back then, so it surprises me that she got so much hate.\n\nNow I have a better idea of how talented she was during the early 2000s, and she had a drive to succeed that I wish I would've had back then. This was a great analysis video and hearing those clips from some of her songs brought back some good memories that I completely forgot. Looks like youtube recommendations got something right today lol.",
        "People forget how YOUNG she was when she was discovered.  She very well have spent time grinding the punk and underground scene if she hadn't been discovered so young. Probably not many 13 year olds grinding out the underground scene ;)",
        "I loved Avril Lavigne's music since Complicated and I'm dude. Even those new songs she's in are good. I got nothing but mad respect for her.",
        "Complicated was the soundtrack to my last breakup. Never did I think that I would have been relating to Avril Lavigne as a then 25 year old man as much as I did but low and behold I did.",
        "I love Avril Lavigne for her music, no matter what people have said about her. I do love her first two albums, and Goodbye Lullaby is one of my personal favourite albums from her too, I love that album so much. I know sometimes, it hasn't all been great, and I know a lot of her recent stuff has been hit and miss, but I still think she is still great and I am happy to love her music today.",
        "Oh my god a year of sporadically begging you to make this video and you do it 6 months ago and I miss it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm embarrassed haha. But the fact that we share the same favorite Avril song was a magical moment. Another amazing video Finn!!!",
        "Her attitude toward the label, is what made her punkheck yeah",
        "As a late millennial (born in '94) you spoke to my soul with this video. Can you make more videos that touch that era of early '00s and the effect they had on us, kids and young teens? My generation literally got into the alternative/dark scene by these artists that were huge at the time, linkin park, system of a down, green day, avril lavigne, evanescence, and I remember that \"true\" metalheads/goths/punks etc were mocking them. To us though, they were the bridge that brought us to this scene only to discover more and more",
        "Great insight.  She has always been a guilty pleasure artist for me (I‚Äôm a grunger so‚Ä¶integrity lol) but I now have a deeper understanding of her struggle coming up and her vision.  Cheers!",
        "I think you're a bloody legend, Finn. I loved this video,  and I think I'm not alone in saying that I had fallen for some of those stereotypes of her too.\n\nGrade A research, insight and delivery.\n\nThanks heaps.",
        "Love Avril Lavigne. She's one of the voices of my teenage Saturdays.",
        "I actually regret hiding the fact I heard her music when I was a kid. Looking back, Avril Lavigne is the reason why Paramore and Blink 182 grew on me.\n\nGirlfriend was my jam",
        "I remember that even my older brother, who isn't interested in Rock music at all, had a crush on her back in 2002.",
        "damn it. I have not felt this personally attacked....I was one of those people, who, kind of liked her music, but hated her being mentioned having anything to do with punk. Of course, at the time, I was listening to NOFX a lot, not realizing the irony of \"keeping punk rock elite\". Well, ther great thing about being a human, is is the ability to reason, and admit just how wrong I was. Thanks again, Finn.",
        "Thank you for making this man. I always try to tell people over the years about the deeper story. Really glad to see an official and so well done video on it ",
        "People hate Avril? What? I'm a 32 year old guy so was about 12 when she was new. In junior high I openly said I loved her, and so did some of my jock friends. I've never heard anyone talk shit about her back then or now.",
        "She is iconic, talented and has always had a personality",
        "never forget her amazing band that made the let go , mark spicoluck evan and matt they were awesome",
        "I‚Äôve always  liked Avril.  I remember seeing her and her band cover Fuel at the MTV Metallica Icon show.  She is very talented and probably the most diverse singer I‚Äôve ever heard since 2002.  The girl can sing anything.  I still follow her today.",
        "Avril Lavigne was a guilty pleasure of mine back then at age ~12. Unfortunately, among prepubescent boys, it was not cool to publicly admit that you liked her or her music since she wasn't considered \"a real punk\" like Blink 182 etc (yes, the irony is not lost on me). But secretly, I really enjoyed her songs, even the more sappy ones, and of course I also had a huge crush on her, as I now suspect all the other boys secretly did as well lol.",
        "I think Avril just gets criticized more than other artists that all have the same standard when making music. \nHer music speaks for itself. She carries the team.",
        "the DIY mentality in the punk and hardcore scene for all the good its done is partially to blame for this, at least in my mind it affected whether I liked an artist for most of my life until recently and even now if I know your grind was significant and your songs are solely yours and your bands I respect it more, I'm not saying it's right just using myself as an example. Anyway love the videos finn",
        "Avril reminds me of KISS: She has tons of clout, she is divisive but everyone in certain demos knows her, she has an incredible business acumen, and in some ways the music is the least important part of her whole thing, she's not precious about some average rock dude's idea of \"authenticity\", which in the end is smart IMO.\n\n... Actually, she probably has more #1's than KISS ever did! \nEDIT: I just checked and she kicks their ass!!",
        "I was a big Avril Lavigne fan back in high school. I don't know but she really have the charisma or magic i can't explain that made me like her and her music. Hearing this solidified my respect to her",
        "Loved avril back in the day. Still love her. She is def iconic",
        "She's always been my guilty pleasure. She's had a few songs over the years that, despite not being my style overall AT ALL, were REALLY good. She writes her own stuff, too...super talented. And she's screamin' hot. lol",
        "I get what you're saying about her being a visionary, and taking control of her career, but PINK was actually the first person I remember being in the Edgy girl lane first with her MISUNDERSTOOD album.",
        "Always liked Avril. Even during my elitist days I've always thought that her first two albums were great. \n\nBut it's clear that her popularity was primarily based around her image rather than her music. Cause her music early on draws very little from pop-punk. Save for a couple of songs. (And I don't think that's enough to classify her as such)\n\nJust going based solely off of the music she creates. She can basically be summed up as the post-grunge version of Alanis Morrissette. I hear way more Alanis, Shania, and Staind in her than I do Green Day or Good Charlotte. \n\nAlso don't understand why people label her as manufactured either. To me that label gets thrown around too often and is more so used to try and delegitimize the success of an artist for no valid reason. If we want to be technical here... Most bands and artists that get on Top 40 stations have to get there with SOME level of help. It's not always JUST about the music, And those artists don't always get a choice. \n\nNickelback for example wrote songs for the purpose of getting them played on radio stations, And Linkin Park had to simplify their lyricism on their debut album since the labels wouldn't accept them otherwise. If we want to talk manufactured... Puddle Of Mudd technically falls under that category since every member of that band besides Wes Scantlin was hand selected by Fred Durst, And they got airplay based primarily on his influence. But nobody ever thinks of them as such.\n\nPoint is, Most big name artists are manufactured to a point. I wouldn't call Avril anymore manufactured than most 2000's artists/bands. And to act like some label just magically put together her image as a pop-punk/post-grunge icon is just ridiculous. Her songs made it big with outside help yes, But her image itself was big because it was genuine. She was a young girl that made the kind of music she wanted to make, The label couldn't produce that themselves.",
        "I'm not a fan of her music not my style but I respect what shes done",
        "Good job writing and organizing your synopsis‚Äôs finn. Great job.",
