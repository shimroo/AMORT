Which song would you suggest?\" I said, \"NO DANCING QUEEN!\" (because that is always the obvious choice).  I wanted a song that the average casual ABBA listener most likely had never heard of, and one I loved. 'As Good As new' was it!  Also, my niece and her boyfriend had been together for 10 years, so this wedding was to make their relationship 'as good as new.'  During the reception, the music was pretty lame. An hour later, my niece approached us and said, \"He has not played your song yet?\" I said no. She marched over to the DJ.....and within 5 minutes, the strings we know and love came on.  Everyone stopped. What was this???  Then the strings stopped and the song hit!  I knew people would jump. I dragged my niece (still in her wedding gown!) and my partner to the dance floor and we let it loose.  And the dance floor, which was almost empty until now, was suddenly full.  People loved this!  And it forced the DJ to finally start playing great music to follow.  I have known and loved this song since 1979 and now, every time I hear it, I think of Gabrielle's wedding.",

        "Una de las m√°s grandes composiciones de ABBA. ABBA pone la innovaci√≥n y el arte por encima de lo f√°cil, mon√≥tono y comercial. \"Hole In Your Soul\" es de esas canciones explosivas y avasalladoras que te sacuden el alma. Est√° muy bien construida con quiebres de ritmos, contrapuntos musicales y vocales. Tiene una atm√≥sfera progresiva, vanguard√≠sta, algo que no caracteriz√≥ a ABBA  y que solamente lo logr√≥ con esta y algunas otras canciones de su √°lbum m√°s serio \"The Album\"  y con el √∫ltimo track del √°lbum The Visitors ‚ÄúLike An Angel Passing Through My Room‚Äù",

Finally, the way the two women walk into the sunset. They lost  the loves of their lives, but they gained the deepest friendship of their lives.",
        "That guitar strumming that sounds every time they say \"knowing you\" is a clear example of their level. It may seem something simple but using a counterpoint that way, breaking the rhythmic 4/4 pattern, is something that most bands won't do often, specially today.",

The name reflects the emotional and introspective nature of Adele's songs, which often evoke deep feelings and reflections, akin to the act of daydreaming.\n\nIn her song \"Daydreamer\" she described her first crush on this perfect boy from her childhood. In an open interview she once said that \"Daydreamer\" is basically her dream man, her ideal perfect man. Although she can never have such a person in her life (as claimed by her), her fans adopted the name \"Daydreamers\" to commemorate that even though she may not have that perfect man, she will always have us.

They did in the end get a hit record but were never producing the full on aerosmith sound anymore except pump but thats it.",
