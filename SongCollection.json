If they agree with me then they will definitely like it . Just commented to describe my feelings that's it. Everyone else are just fighting with each other by his judging whether that guy belongs to our country or not. Whether he is Hindu OR Muslim. C'mon guys talent is pure it's don't have any of this. Every talented person have his own identity and there this type of stupid debates are not arises. \n\n\nThank You ",

I could never explain how much I love her. I wish I could love her by the last breath of my life. She was a blessing in my life.  together we were in our best versions. Nowadays I see her everywhere, this is not a kind of funny illusion, it actually happening to me, maybe it is the effect of her love. I would say Love is not about staying together, It's about the bonding we made together. I don't know if she still loves me or not, but I believe she also feels the same as I do. the thing is like, we are made for each other. But there is a word called \"FAASLE\"... I still believe we will be together someday. She taught me what is love, and now I am looking for her to make her smile for the rest of my life. ",
