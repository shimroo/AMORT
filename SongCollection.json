I could never explain how much I love her. I wish I could love her by the last breath of my life. She was a blessing in my life.  together we were in our best versions. Nowadays I see her everywhere, this is not a kind of funny illusion, it actually happening to me, maybe it is the effect of her love. I would say Love is not about staying together, It's about the bonding we made together. I don't know if she still loves me or not, but I believe she also feels the same as I do. the thing is like, we are made for each other. But there is a word called \"FAASLE\"... I still believe we will be together someday. She taught me what is love, and now I am looking for her to make her smile for the rest of my life. ",
